# ðŸ”’ Smart Access Control System

### Overview
Developed a secure RFID-based access control system using ESP32.  
Designed custom PCB with Altium Designer, simulated hardware, and 3D-printed an enclosure for integration.

### Features
- Secure UID storage with SPIFFS on ESP32
- Custom PCB for compact hardware
- Functional prototype validated with RFID tags
- Enclosure prototyped with Creality Ender S3 (3D printing)

### Tech Stack
ESP32, C++, Altium Designer, SPIFFS, 3D Printing
